# Alsphe Features

- You keep you level/exp in every server the bot is in and you also gain it if you do the commands or you type
- a changeable Welcome Channel (Currently not working)
- a changeable prefix if you do not like our default one
- Text to Ascii-Art so you can add large and cool text to your stuff
- Moderation Commands, (no unban and warn commands yet)
- 3 commands that link to Reddit for memes, jokes, etc
- Giveaway Commands
- Gambling with Economy
- A database so nothing gets reset on a restart/update
- Reporting System (you will need a channel called "discord-reports" for this to work)
- Logging system for all our Moderation Commands

- If you are not happy about the bot having "Administrator" remove it, but if you want Moderation commands to work you will have to give him the right stuff to do all those things, e.g. muting requires the "Manage Roles" Permission and Banning requires the "Ban Members" permission, if you have any questions join our Discord here: https://discord.gg/ZWDMATr

- We hope you enjoy Alsphe, if you haven't added it yet here if the Invite Link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=725337225268691095&permissions=8&scope=bot
